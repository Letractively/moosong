The rather marvellous [OpenSong](http://www.opensong.org/) is used in many churches around the world. MooSong is a web based program to allow a church to organise the running order of services as a team. Collaborating from their own homes during the week in order to allow smooth and stress free worship, for worship leaders, AV crew and leadership / clergy.

## Current features include ##
  * Drag and drop OpenSong Set editing.
  * Song searching.
  * Service templates.
  * Reading look up which finds which page in your churches bible the reading is on and puts that up on the screen.
  * Video & Presentation upload.
  * Youtube / Vimeo etc. integration.
  * SVN integration so that a team can work on a service at the same time without edit conflict issues, and a service download is via an SVN client.
  * SVN footprint reduction (different data folders can be individual or shared so as to minimize both conflict and file system usage).
  * Fetch notices from a google calendar.
  * PDF print outs of the service running order.
